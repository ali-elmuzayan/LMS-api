Auth Module

User types:
 - Students
 - Admins
 - Instructor



Key feature to implement:
-------------------------
 1. REgistration system
    - Different forms for students/ instructor
    - Email verification
    - Admin approval for instructor (optional) // so we can make the user wait for approve
 2. Login/ Logout
    - sanctum tokens
    - Remember
 3. Security
    - Rate Limiter
    - password policies
    - CSRF protection
    - verifications
 4. Notifications
    - email verification
    - admin notifications for new registration
    - password reset



Additional Considerations:
 - Social Login                 => Google and facebook
 - Two-Factor Authentication    => For instructors/Admins
 - Password Reset Flow          => standard laravel implementation
 - Account Deactivation         => for Admin management



Admin features with
 - Approve/reject instructor
 - Ban Users
 - View all users
